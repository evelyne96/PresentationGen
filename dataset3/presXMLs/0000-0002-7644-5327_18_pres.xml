<p>Reality Check
.=</p>
<p>Think about how academic hiring really works...
.=</p>
<p>candidates mentally rank schools into top tier, second tier,
etc, but don’t really know how they would choose between
schools within the same tier
.=</p>
<p>likewise, schools (often explicitly) rank candidates into tiers
.=</p>
<p>schools interview a small number of candidates
.=</p>
<p>interviews are informative for both candidates and schools
.=</p>
<p>at the end, based on the interviews everyone matches up
.=</p>
<p>Our goal: build a model to explain why this process works as well
as it does (and perhaps to identify ways that it can fail).

<p>Our Model
.=</p>
<p>We consider a relaxed model in which:
.=</p>
<p>Agents start out unsure of their own preferences
.=</p>
<p>They know a (true) partition of agents on the other side of the
market into strictly ranked equivalence classes
.=</p>
<p>In reality agents do have strict preferences
.=</p>
<p>Initial information can be refined through interviews, which
are informative to both parties to the interview
.=</p>
<p>Goal: find a (true) stable matching that is optimal for a given
side of the market, by performing as few interviews as possible.

<p>Policies
.=</p>
<p>Definition (Information State)
.=</p>
<p>The information state Ii of agent i after interviews with ` ≥ 0
candidates is a list of these ` candidates, ordered according to the
underlying true preference profile. The global information state
after a sequence of interviews is I = ⋃i Ii.
.=</p>
<p>Definition (Policy)
.=</p>
<p>A policy is a mapping from a global information state I either to
an interview to perform or to a matching. A policy is sound if it is
guaranteed to return an employer-optimal matching, regardless of
the true preference order.

<p>But... as few interviews as possible on which underlying

The policy depends on the results of the interviews!

<p>Impossibility Claim
.=</p>
<p>Although we can find necessary and impossible matchings
tractably, this information isn’t as useful as it might seem. It is
sometimes still necessary for these pairs to interview when we aim
to identify the employer-optimal matching.

<p>avoid all interviews between necessary matches; and/or

<p>avoid all interviews between impossible matches.

<p>A pair (I, µ) is an optimality certificate if µ is the employer-optimal
matching for every preference ordering refining global information state I.
The size of (I, µ) is the number of interviews performed in I.
.=</p>
<p>Definition (Minimum optimality certificate for ≻)
.=</p>
<p>(I, µ) is a minimum optimality certificate for a total ordering ≻ if µ is the
employer-optimal matching for ≻, ≻ refines I, and if there does not exist
a smaller optimality certificate (I ′, µ) such that ≻ refines I ′.
.=</p>
<p>Theorem
A policy computes a minimum optimality certificate for every preference
profile if and only if it is very weakly dominant.

<p>Hardness of finding minimum optimality certificates
.=</p>
<p>Theorem (Hardness; informal)
.=</p>
<p>Finding a minimum optimality certificate is NP-hard.
.=</p>
<p>Formal statement of the theorem uses a decision version of
the minimum optimality certificate problem
.=</p>
<p>The proof is a reduction from the feedback arc set problem.
.=</p>
<p>Corollary
.=</p>
<p>It is NP-hard to find a very weakly dominant policy if one exists.

<p>What does this result mean?
.=</p>
<p>The fact that minimum certificates are hard to find seems like
evidence against the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm
for finding optimal-in-expectation or Pareto optimal policies
.=</p>
<p>However, we don’t know if finding minimum certificates is
necessary for such policies.
.=</p>
<p>Determining the hardness of computing an
optimal-in-expectation or Pareto optimal policy remains an
open problem.

<p>Symmetric partial information on one side of the market
.=</p>
<p>Consider two restrictions on our partial information setting:
.=</p>
<p>1 all applicants start out with the same equivalence classes
.=</p>
<p>but not necessarily the same underlying preference orderings
and, if there is a prior, not necessarily the same distributions
.=</p>
<p>2 your boss won’t let you hire someone you haven’t interviewed
.=</p>
<p>A Pareto optimal policy can take O(S) space to write down.
.=</p>
<p>i.e., space exponential in the size of the input
.=</p>
<p>However, in this restricted setting it turns out that we can
execute an optimal policy tractably.

<p>Conclusions
.=</p>
<p>We extended classical two-sided matching to a model in which
agents are endowed with partial preference information.
.=</p>
<p>A very weakly dominant policy may not exist.
.=</p>
<p>Both an optimal-in-expectation policy and a Pareto optimal
policy always exist; both can be computed in exponential time.
.=</p>
<p>We can tractably identify necessary and impossible matches,
but nevertheless can’t avoid these interviews
.=</p>
<p>Finding a minimum optimality certificate is NP-hard, and thus
so is finding a very weak dominant policy, if one exists.
.=</p>
<p>When all applicants begin with the same equivalence classes,
we can execute a very weakly dominant policy in polytime.
.=</p>
<p>Key open questions: hardness of executing optimal policies in
general; hardness of approximation; characterizing settings where a
linear number of interviews suffices; studying decentralized policies.
