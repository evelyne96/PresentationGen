<p>Pach–Tóth, 2000; Pelsmajer–Schaefer–Štefankovič, 2007)
.=</p>
<p>If a graph G has an even drawing D in the plane (every pair of edges

<p>(Cairns–Nikolayevsky, 2000; Pelsmajer–Schaefer–Štefankovič, 2009)
.=</p>
<p>If a graph G has an even drawing D on a surface S, then G has an
embedding on S (that preserves the embedding scheme of D).

.=</p>
<p>If a graph G has an independently even drawing on the projective

<p>Problem: Can the strong Hanani–Tutte theorem be extended to

<p>Theorem: (Fulek–K., 2017)

<p>There is a graph G with g(G) = 5 and g0(G) ≤ 4.

<p>Theorem: (Schaefer–Štefankovič, 2013)

<p>If G consists of t copies of K5 or K3 3 sharing at most 1 vertex, then,
g0(G) = g(G) = t .
(The Z2-genus is additive for disjoint unions and 1-amalgamations.)
.=</p>
<p>Observation:
.=</p>
<p>If G has maximum degree 3, then g0(G) = g(G). In particular, the
Z2-genus of the projective t-wall is ⌊t/2⌋.
