<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Motivation: Napster System
(May 1999 – July 2001)
.=</p>
<p>Dominant strategy for non-altruistic agents to 
share nothing and download as much as possible
.=</p>
<p>free-rider problem
study of Gnutella: 70% of users shared nothing
.=</p>
<p>Why does anyone share?
client requires users to opt out of sharing
service free, fosters sense of community
.=</p>
<p>Why isn’t this enough?
advent of for-profit systems
service with more shared files is more competitive
.=</p>
<p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 2.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Outline
Unlike talk on Monday, no discussion of fair 
exchange, escrow, watermarking issues
Model:
.=</p>
<p>a very simple game-theoretic model of a P2P file sharing 
system, free-rider problem
.=</p>
<p>Theory:
pros and cons of three payment schemes that give rise to 
strict equilibria in which free-riding does not occur
.=</p>
<p>Experiments:
robust convergence to the same equilibria in an enriched 
model; also some interesting behaviors
.=</p>
<p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 3.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Model
Single-shot game in which agents choose a 
level of sharing, level of downloading
Utility depends on:
.=</p>
<p>amount downloaded
variety of the network
disk space used
bandwidth used
altruism
financial transfer
.=</p>
<p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 4.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Micro-Payments
Scheme:
.=</p>
<p>charge users for downloads, reward them for uploads
overall, the system breaks even
.=</p>
<p>Advantage:
unique, strict equilibrium for all agents to both share and 
download maximally
.=</p>
<p>Disadvantages:
equilibrium doesn’t hold for risk-averse agents: they don’t 
directly control their number of uploads
users can make a profit
users dislike micro-payments
.=</p>
<p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 5.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Quantized Micro-Payments
Scheme:
.=</p>
<p>charge a fixed price for each block of b files
reward uploads as before
.=</p>
<p>Advantages:
may be preferable to users
unique, strict equilibrium as before
.=</p>
<p>Disadvantage:
collusion: agents can direct their zero-marginal-
cost downloads to others
.=</p>
<p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 6.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Points, Rewarding Sharing
Scheme:
.=</p>
<p>“points” currency: points can be bought but not sold
pay agents for size of material shared
.=</p>
<p>Advantage:
no agent makes a profit
maximal sharing, downloading is a strict equilibrium
.=</p>
<p>Disadvantages:
no sharing, maximal downloading is also strict equilibrium
agents don’t want their shared files to be downloaded 
.=</p>
<p>share at off-peak times, share unpopular files
.=</p>
<p>agent could stop sharing as soon as a file is requested
.=</p>
<p>October 17, 2001 EC'01 7.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experimental Results
Experiments using TD Q-learning
Validate and enrich our theoretical model:
.=</p>
<p>levels of risk-aversion
utility functions 
different types of files and agents
.=</p>
<p>Experiments:
strategy convergence in this richer setting
interesting effects
