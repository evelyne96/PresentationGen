<p>The Task
.=</p>
<p>Spoken language recognition is a pattern recognition task that
consists of recognizing the language spoken in an utterance by
computational means
.=</p>
<p>The main complexity of language recognition tasks comes from
dealing with undesired variabilities present in the utterances due to
several factors: channel variabilities
.=</p>
<p>Extracting informative features robust against those variabilities or
designing modeling techniques capable of patterning after the
desired variabilities, while discarding the noisy ones, are the main
focus of research in the task

<p>Under the i-vector modeling assumption, an utterance GMM
supervector (stacking the means of a GMM which is estimated by
MAP adaptation of the UBM to the input utterance) is defined as:
.=</p>
<p>M = m + Tw (1)
m is the utterance independent mean supervector
.=</p>
<p>T is the total variability matrix (a low-rank rectangular matrix)
.=</p>
<p>w is the so called i-vector, a normally distributed
low-dimensional latent vector
.=</p>
<p>M is assumed to be normally distributed with mean m and
covariance TT′
.=</p>
<p>The latent vector w can be estimated from its posterior
distribution conditioned to the Baum-Welch statistics

<p>Assuming a classification task with flat priors, the
log-likelihood ratios at each frame t can be computed from
posterior probabilities as follows:
.=</p>
<p>| p(i |t)PLLR(i t) = log 1 i = 1, ...,N (6)
(N−1) (1− p(i |t))
.=</p>
<p>In this way, n log-likelihood ratios are computed at each frame
t, carrying the same information as the n phone posteriors,
but seemingly featuring Gaussian distributions
.=</p>
<p>These are the Phone Log-Likelihood Ratio (PLLR) features

<p>Correlation: An iterative clustering algorithm is used. In each step,
the algorithm merges the closest pair of phones according to the
correlation among the phone posterior probabilities
.=</p>
<p>Frequency: The N phones with the highest posterior probabilities
overall in the training set are selected and used as (reduced) phone
set
.=</p>
<p>PCA was also tested. Since PCA is an orthogonal transformation
that is assumed to deal with normally distributed data ranging in
(−∞,∞), it is not a suitable transformation to be applied on the
phone posterior probability space. Instead, PCA is directly applied
on the normally distributed PLLR space

<p>To avoid this bounding effect, we propose to project PLLRs into
the hyper-plane tangential to the surface at the point where all the
posteriors take the same value p = 1i N , that is, the top of the
convex surface, where the normal vector is:
.=</p>
<p>(N − 1)

<p>Summary
.=</p>
<p>PLLR feature-based systems improve Spoken Language

<p>L∑et us consider the case in which a subset of phonesI ⊂ {1, 2, ...,N} acco∑unts for most of the pr∑obability mass, that is,∀i∈I pi = 1− . As these phones tend to take all the probability
mass, it follows that ∀i∈I pi → 1 and  = ∀i∈/I pi → 0
(therefore, ri → −∞ ∀i ∈/ I). Accordingly, for the normal vector n
it holds:
.=</p>
<p>lim ni = 0 ∀i ∈/ I (14)
→0
.=</p>
<p>That is, the normal vector tends to lie in the subspace Q where the
set of phones I are confined. Hence, the surface is asymptotically
perpendicular to any basis defined on Q.
