PROGRAMMING.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>WHY FOCUS ON SCHEDULING PROBLEMS
.=</p>
<p>∙ Resources are very expensive (time or money measures) and we
need optimal solutions for scheduling
.=</p>
<p>∙ Need for intelligent optimal systems
∙ Similar solutions can be implemented for many problems such as
personnel, machine , project scheduling etc
.=</p>
<p>2.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>WHY USE CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING?
.=</p>
<p>∙ Scheduling problems naturally defined with their constraints in
mind, thus it is easy to model with CSP
.=</p>
<p>∙ Depending on resources and needed constraints to satisfy it can
become a combinatorial problem
.=</p>
<p>∙ Concentrates on the WHAT of the problem instead of the HOW
∙ Many effective ways already implemented that can boost up the
search for the solutions
.=</p>
<p>3.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>EXAMPLES
.=</p>
<p>∙ Generating university timetables [Zhang and Lau, 2005]
.=</p>
<p>∙ Project scheduling [Relich, 2013]
.=</p>
<p>5.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>UNIVERSITY TIMETABLES
.=</p>
<p>∙ NP complete problem, difficult to find optimal solution
.=</p>
<p>∙ Constraints based on time restrictions and resource sharing
(class rooms, teachers)
.=</p>
<p>∙ Students attend one class at the same time, the room must be
big enough for all the attending students, no core subject is
scheduled at the same time, and only one class is scheduled in
one room at any one timeslot.
.=</p>
<p>6.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>UNIVERSITY TIMETABLES
.=</p>
<p>∙ Each timetable item is an activity and rooms are resources
.=</p>
<p>∙ Solution: Defined model in ILOG
.=</p>
<p>∙ ILOG is a constraint optimization software developed by IBM for
CSP (mainly scheduling problems)
.=</p>
<p>∙ https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-cp-optimizer
.=</p>
<p>7.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>UNIVERSITY TIMETABLES
.=</p>
<p>∙ ILOG decompesses programs by separating the model from the
search algorithm itself
.=</p>
<p>∙ Model built with ILOG scheduler
.=</p>
<p>∙ Resources represented in IloActivity
.=</p>
<p>∙ The ILOG Solver generates a goal and goes thorough the search
space to find the solution
.=</p>

<p>∙ Results analyze the number of backtracked nodes (fails) and
number of choice point (nr of visited nodes)

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>FUZZY PROJECT SCHEDULING
.=</p>
<p>∙ When developing multiple project at the same time sometimes
we need to share some resources between then
.=</p>
<p>∙ Constraint: project/task dependencies, human resource
management, financial resource management
.=</p>
<p>∙ Need for tools to help in scheduling the projects
.=</p>
<p>11.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>FUZZY PROJECT SCHEDULING
.=</p>
<p>∙ Estimating needed time and money for development is very
challenging
.=</p>
<p>∙ Need to include imprecise estimation for time/money
.=</p>
<p>∙ Solution: consider 3 levels of risk management -> optimistic,
pessimistic, intermediate by implementing α cuts
.=</p>
<p>12.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>FUZZY PROJECT SCHEDULING
.=</p>
<p>∙ Set of projects P = P1,P2, ...,PI, where the project P i consists of J
activities: Pi = Ai,1, ...,Ai,j, ...,Ai,J
.=</p>
<p>∙ Each activity is defined by their start time and duration
.=</p>
<p>∙ The imprecise variables are defined by α cuts, where the α -cut is
a crisp set consisting of elements of A which belong to the fuzzy
set at least to a degree of α ( 0 < α <= 1 ). An α -cut is a method of
defuzzifying a fuzzy set to a crisp set at desired α -levels that
correspond to the perceived risk (α=1 meaning no risk, α=0+
meaning the highest risk)

<p>∙ Cost for unit of time calculated by dividing the cost of every
activity by its duration.
.=</p>
<p>∙ Financial cost allocating by taking into account all α-levels of a
fuzzy number
.=</p>
<p>∙ minDα (best case scenerio, activity starts as soon as possible)
∙ maxDα (activity starts at latest possible time).
.=</p>
<p>minDα = [α(ba) + a, α(ed) + d]
.=</p>
<p>maxDα = [α(bc) + c, α(ef) + f]

.=</p>
<p>The aim of the Fuzzy scheduling is to create a fuzzy cash flow for
different risk levels, which would help the project managers to
determine which schedule would be the best option, by considering
the different levels in terms of duration and cost efficiency

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>CONCLUSION
.=</p>
<p>∙ The interest in scheduling is big, because it allows good resource
allocation and time optimization
.=</p>
<p>∙ Many other use cases other than the two mentioned in this
paper: nurse scheduling, doctor scheduling, virual machine
scheduling etc
.=</p>
<p>∙ Constraint programming is successfully applied to these
problems by using well defined elements for consistency
technique and constraint propagation
