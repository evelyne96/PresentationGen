help bidders in an auction?
.=</p>
<p>proxy bidders (eBay, etc.)
really just transform English into 2nd-price auction
.=</p>
<p>automation
aggregation of information from different auctions
bidding advice, decision support
bidding clubs
.=</p>
<p>instead of helping one user, help a group
aggregate bidders’ market power
unlike “buyer clubs”, bidders’ interests not aligned
.=</p>
<p>self-enforcing collusive agreement: increase expected utility

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Collusion Example
Imagine a first-price auction with 6 bidders, 
3 of whom decide to collude in advance
.=</p>
<p>Is there a pre-agreement that can benefit some, 
but penalize none?
.=</p>
<p>Naïve proposal: 
each bidder submits her valuation
the two low bidders drop out 
the bidder with the highest valuation bids lower in the main 
auction
.=</p>
<p>Bidders have an incentive to lie in the pre-auction!
this is true even if the high bidder pays the other two to 
drop out

* with Y. Shoham, M. Tennenholtz  (EC’00)
.=</p>
<p>Bidders:
N = {1, 2, …, n}: a set of bidders who will 
participate in an auction, A
G ⊂ N: a set of bidders who are invited to 
participate in a pre-auction
.=</p>
<p>Coordinator c:
Can c hold a pre-auction that will benefit some of 
G and penalize none?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Assumptions: Coordinator
The coordinator:
.=</p>
<p>invites some subset of bidders to participate
non-binding invitation
.=</p>
<p>may enforce payments from, between bidders
cannot cost money to operate
acts only as a representative of bidders
.=</p>
<p>why can it be trusted to act reliably?
one way of looking at it is that c combines with A
to form a new mechanism
c’s behavior is fully specified, common knowledge

<p>IPV model, no externalities

<p>IID from distribution F
First-price auction equilibrium bid:

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Deviation from standard GT setting
.=</p>
<p>Uninvited agents are not aware of the 
possibility of the existence of a coordinator
.=</p>
<p>they believe that each bid placed corresponds to a 
single bidder
.=</p>
<p>they may be wrong about the number of bidders 
“actually” participating in auction
.=</p>
<p>Is this realistic?  Maybe so for electronic auctions.

<p>Equilibrium concept

1. Coordinator c invites agents from G to 
.=</p>
<p>participate in a pre-auction
2. Bidders decide whether to accept the invitation
3. c asks agents for their valuations 
.=</p>
<p>agents may lie!
.=</p>
<p>4. c bids on behalf of some or all bidders in the 
main auction
.=</p>
<p>5. c may impose monetary transfers between 
and from bidding club members

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Utility-Improving Coordinator
.=</p>
<p>1. Every agent in G who would have 
participated in A will choose to 
participate in the bidding club
.=</p>
<p>2. Each agents’ expected utility from 
participating in the bidding club is 
greater than his expected utility in A
.=</p>

</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Second-Price Auction: Protocol
* in the spirit of Graham & Marshall, 1987
.=</p>
<p>A utility-improving coordinator exists for second-price auctions.
1. Agents from G submit valuations to coordinator c
2. If any agent chose not to participate:
.=</p>
<p>submit a bid for each agent i who did elect to participate with 
price offer vi, and end the protocol
.=</p>
<p>3. Let v1, v2 be the two highest valuations announced, by agent 1 and 
agent 2 respectively
.=</p>
<p>4. Only agent 1 is represented in the main auction, with a bid of v1
5. If agent 1 wins, he must pay vsec to the auctioneer and max(v2 –
.=</p>
<p>vsec , 0) to c
6. c gives a payment of p to all agents in G
.=</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Calculating p
Assume agents truthful, participate
.=</p>
<p>Taking into account only n, |G|, F, it is possible for c
to calculate his expected gain, g
.=</p>
<p>c gains whenever both the global highest and second-
highest bids are members of the bidding club
.=</p>
<p>Pick any s ≥ |G|; set p = g/s
On expectation c will:
.=</p>
<p>be budget balanced when s = |G|
make a profit when s > |G|
.=</p>
<p>Friday, July 13, 2001 Infonomics Workshop, Maastricht 12.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Why this works
Incentive Compatibility:
.=</p>
<p>With p = 0, the allocation rule and payment rule are exactly 
the same as in second-price auction
.=</p>
<p>the standard argument for incentive compatibility applies
.=</p>
<p>p does not depend on agents’ declarations, so this payment 
does not affect agents’ strategies
.=</p>
<p>The bidding club increases agents’ expected gain
Exactly the same outcome as in second-price auction
.=</p>
<p>But: all bidders receive an additional payment of p > 0
Declining participation is not informative:
.=</p>
<p>All bidders from G will bid their valuations
.=</p>
<p>Friday, July 13, 2001 Infonomics Workshop, Maastricht 13.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Observations
.=</p>
<p>The coordinator’s maximum loss in a given 
round is |G|p = |G|g/s. 
.=</p>
<p>Since s may be arbitrarily big, maximum loss may 
be set arbitrarily close to 0
.=</p>
<p>c keeps all but an arbitrarily small fraction of g
Efficiency of the auction is preserved
.=</p>
<p>Revenue equivalence: doesn’t hold because a 
bidder in G who bids 0 can still gain p
.=</p>
<p>Friday, July 13, 2001 Infonomics Workshop, Maastricht 14.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>First-Price Auction: Protocol
A utility-improving coordinator exists for first-price auctions
.=</p>
<p>1. Agents from G submit valuations to c
2. If any agent declined to participate
.=</p>
<p>submit a bid for each agent i who did elect to participate 
with price offer b(F, n, vi), and end the protocol
.=</p>
<p>3. Submit a bid for (only) the bidder from G with the 
highest valuation, of b(F, m, v1), m = n - |G| + 1
.=</p>
<p>4. If he wins, his payment to c is b(F, n, v1) - b(F, m, v1)
5. c gives a payment of p to all agents in G
.=</p>
<p>Friday, July 13, 2001 Infonomics Workshop, Maastricht 15.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Calculating p
Assume agents truthful, participate
.=</p>
<p>Taking into account only n, |G|, F, it is 
possible for c to calculate his expected gain, g
.=</p>
<p>c gains b(F, n, v1) - b(F, m, v1) whenever the 
globally highest bidder is a member of G
.=</p>
<p>Pick any s ≥ |G|; set p = g/s as before
.=</p>
<p>Friday, July 13, 2001 Infonomics Workshop, Maastricht 16.=</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Why this works
Incentive Compatibility:
.=</p>
<p>With p = 0, the allocation rule and payment rule are exactly 
the same as in first-price auction
.=</p>
<p>c implements a revelation mechanism
p does not depend on agents’ declarations, so this payment 
does not affect agents’ strategies
.=</p>
<p>The bidding club increases agents’ expected gain
Exactly the same outcome as in first-price auction
.=</p>
<p>But: all bidders receive an additional payment of p > 0
Declining participation is not informative:
.=</p>
<p>Every agent in G will follow the equilibrium strategy
.=</p>
<p>The bidding club benefits agents outside G
their equilibrium bids are reduced
