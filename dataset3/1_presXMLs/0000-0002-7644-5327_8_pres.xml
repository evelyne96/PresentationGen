<p>Combinatorial Auctions
</p>
<p>There are multiple goods for sale.
</p>
<p>Bidders may have non-additive valuations over goods.
</p>
<p>Definition (CA mechanism)
</p>
<p>In a combinatorial auction (CA) mechanism, multiple goods are
sold simultaneously and bidders are allowed to place bids on
bundles, rather than just on individual goods.
The mechanism decides on the allocation of goods and the
payments given the bids.

</p>
<p>A CA mechanism is revenue monotonic if adding a bidder never

each may or may not participate in a given auction
</p>
<p>Definition (Single-minded bidder)

<p>A bidder i is single minded if she has the valuation function:
</p>
<p>∀s ∈ 2G ( ) = { vi > 0 if s ⊇ b, v s i;i 0 otherwise.

<p>Definition (Known single-minded setting)
</p>
<p>In a known single-minded setting, all bidders are single-minded and
the bundles bi are known to the auctioneer.

<p>1. Feasibility Program
</p>
<p>We create variables πv̂(a) and pi(v̂) for each v̂ , a and i.
</p>
<p>We write constraints expressing our desired properties.
</p>
<p>This feasibility program has
</p>
<p>an infinite number of both variables and constraints;
nonlinear constraints; and
(some) strict inequality constraints.

<p>3. Analytic Construction of Solutions to the QCLP
</p>
<p>1 Set π(0,...,0)(a)’s nearly arbitrarily requiring that
π(0,...,0)(a) = 0 if a is not maximal.
</p>
<p>E.g., it’s always OK to set π(0,...,0)(a) = ⟨1, . . . , n⟩,
0 < i < 1, for all maximal a.
many other settings also work; restrictions apply
</p>
<p>2 Pick a δ that satisfies the hardest path from (0, . . . ,0).
</p>
<p>3 Inductively set πv̂(a)’s using δ and realizing weak inequality
constraints as equalities.
</p>
<p>4 Set payments pi(. . . , v̂i, . . .) = ∑ δ.ci,`
1≤`≤ji ∣

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>There is no deterministic CA mechanism that satisfies
strategyproofness, participation, consumer sovereignty,
maximality, and revenue monotonicity.
</p>
<p>In deterministic CA mechanisms, more bidders does not
necessarily mean more competition.
</p>
<p>There exist stepwise randomized CA mechanisms defined for
known single-minded bidders that satisfy strategyproofness,
participation, consumer sovereignty, maximality and revenue
monotonicity.
</p>
<p>We characterized the class of all such mechanisms.
We gave a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing such a
mechanism.

</p>
<p>Future Work
</p>
<p>Identify stepwise randomized mechanisms that maximize
objective functions of interest.
</p>
<p>E.g. identify those that maximize revenue.
</p>
<p>Investigate optimally setting the parameters over which we
have design freedom:
</p>
<p>π(0,...,0)(a)’s;
set of maximal allocations in the support of the mechanism;
γ;
δ (as long as it is small enough); and
ci,j ’s.
</p>
<p>Prove or disprove the conjecture that we can allow ci,j ’s to
depend on v̂ .
Extend our result to unknown single-minded bidders or prove
that such an extension is impossible.
