diversity: similar proportions of show types in all datasets

<p>Different distributions of OOS languages for development and evaluation,

<p>Selection of speech segments (I)
</p>
<p>Task: to extract speech segments from the recorded materials, by listening
and looking at audio signals.
</p>
<p>Criteria:
Multiple speakers allowed
</p>
<p>Single (nominal) language
</p>
<p>Clean/Noisy classification relaxed: mostly clean and mostly noisy segments
</p>
<p>Discarded: (1) narrow-band (telephone-channel) speech and
(2) fragments with multiple languages (even in the background)
</p>
<p>Exception: two or more OOS languages may appear in the same segment
</p>
<p>Tools: Wavesurfer and CoolEdit
</p>
<p>Results:
clean speech: segments of any length greater than 30 seconds
noisy/overlapped speech: segments of length between 30 and 35 seconds

<p>Automatic extraction of 30-, 10- and 3-second segments (I)
</p>
<p>Segments of fixed nominal duration (30, 10 and 3 seconds) extracted from
clean-speech fragments posted to dev and eval.
</p>
<p>Single-pass greedy algorithm:
Segments enclosed by a certain amount of silence.
</p>
<p>A 30-second segment is validated if and only if it contains a valid 10-second
segment. Similarly, a 10-second segment is validated if and only if it
contains a 3-second segment.
</p>
<p>Segments can be slightly longer than their nominal duration.
</p>
<p>Noisy-speech fragments of 30-35 seconds stored as 30-second segments.
</p>
<p>Greedy algorithm applied to extract 10- and 3-second noisy segments.
</p>
<p>Development and evaluation datasets:
Same size and characteristics, except for the distribution of OOS languages
and the proportion of clean and noisy speech.
</p>
<p>At least 150 segments per target language and nominal duration.
</p>
<p>Around 450 OOS segments per nominal duration.

</p>
<p>KALAKA-2: a database containing clean and noisy/overlapped
speech from wide-band TV broadcasts is available for your use.
</p>
<p>It allows to develop and evaluate language recognition systems for
Iberian languages + English.
</p>
<p>Average costs using state-of-the-art technology are high enough to
allow further (statistically significant) improvements in all the tracks,
except for the easiest one (closed-set, clean-speech, 30s segments).
