<p>Balanced sequences
</p>
<p>A infinite sequence v is balanced if for each letter a of the alphabet
A and for all factors u and u′ of v s.t. |u| = |u′| we have that
</p>
<p>||u|a − |u′|a| ≤ 1
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>w = abcadbcadbacbdacbd · · · is a balanced sequence.
v = abcbdbcadbacbdacbd · · · is not a balanced sequence.
</p>
<p>Remark
</p>
<p>For a two-letter alphabet, being balanced is equivalent to being
balanced with respect to one letter.

</p>
<p>Binary case
</p>
<p>An infinite aperiodic sequence v is balanced if and only if v is
a sturmian sequence.
Sturmian sequences are defined as the infinite sequences
having exactly n + 1 distinct factors of length n.
An infinite periodic sequence vω is balanced if and only if v is
a conjugate of a standard word.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Fibonacci words
f0 = b f0 = b f1 = a
f1 = a fn+1 = fnfn−1 (n ≥ 1)
f2 = ab
f3 = aba
</p>
<p>The infinite Fibonacci word is the limit of the sequence of
Fibonacci words.

</p>
<p>Balanced words on larger alphabets
</p>
<p>If |A| > 2, the general structure of balanced words is not
known.
</p>
<p>As a direct consequence of a result of Graham, one has that
balanced sequences on a set of letters having different
frequencies must be periodic.
</p>
<p>Fraenkel’s conjecture
Let Ak = {a1, a2, . . . , ak}. For each k > 2, there is only one
circularly balanced word F ∗k ∈ Ak , having different frequencies. It is
defined recursively as follow F1 = a1 and Fk = Fk−1akFk−1 for all
k ≥ 2.

</p>
<p>Direct product
</p>
<p>Let us define a direct product of two infinite sequences
u = u0u1 · · · and v = v0v1 · · · on Σ = {a, b} as the sequence
</p>
<p>u ⊗ v =< u0, v0 >< u1, v1 > · · · .
</p>
<p>on Σ× Σ.
u : 0 0 1 1
v : 0 1 0 1
</p>
<p>w : a b c d
</p>
<p>We define the degree of product, deg(w), as the cardinality of the
alphabet of the product itself.
</p>
<p>The notion of product of two sequences has been introduced in [P.
Salimov. On uniform recurrence of a direct product. In
AutoMathA 2009], where the author studies the class of uniformly
recurrent sequences such that the product of any of its members
and each uniformly recurrent sequence is also uniformly recurrent.

</p>
<p>Question
</p>
<p>We ask us: when the product of two balanced sequences is
balanced too?
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Consider the Fibonacci sequence f and the sturmian sequence s:
</p>
<p>f : 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 · · ·
s : 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 · · ·
w : a c b a c a d a a d a a c b c a a d a c b · · ·
</p>
<p>w is not a balanced sequence, because w has factors u = aa and v = cb, for which
||u|a − |v |a| = 2.
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>Consider the two following sturmian sequences:
</p>
<p>r : 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 · · ·
z : 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 · · ·
t : a d a b c a b a d a b a c b a d a b a c b · · ·
</p>
<p>t is a balanced sequence.

<p>Conclusions and further works
</p>
<p>We have proved that:
</p>
<p>All balanced (periodic or aperiodic) sequences on an alphabet
with three letters are obtained by the product of two binary
balanced sequences.
</p>
<p>There exist only finitely many balanced sequences on four
letters that can be obtained as product of two binary balanced
sequences. Moreover they are ultimately periodic.

</p>
<p>Conclusions and further works
</p>
<p>Given two integer k and h, one could determine the maximum
degree of the product w = u ⊗ v , such that u, v are balanced
sequences, deg(u) = k and deg(v) = h:
</p>
<p>m(k, h) = max{deg(w) s.t. w = u ⊗ v , u, v ∈ B, deg(u) = k, deg(v) = h}
</p>
<p>where B denotes the set of the balanced sequences.
Example
</p>
<p>u : 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 · · · deg(u) = 2
v : 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 2 2 · · · deg(v) = 3
w : a d b c a d b c d a c b d a c b d c · · · deg(w) = 4
</p>
<p>Several experiments suggest that it is not possible to obtain a
balanced sequence w with deg(w) = 5 or deg(w) = 6 as product
of two balanced sequences u and v , where deg(u) = 2 and
deg(v) = 3.

</p>
<p>Conclusions and further works
</p>
<p>Given k, is it possible to classify the balanced sequences
w = u ⊗ v , with degree(w) = k according to deg(u) and deg(v)?
</p>
<p>Example
</p>
<p>On a four-letter alphabet:
</p>
<p>There exist only finitely many balanced sequences on four
letters that can be obtained as product of two binary balanced
sequences. Moreover they are ultimately periodic.
</p>
<p>The balanced sequence w = u⊗ v = adbcadbcdacbdacbdc · · ·
is obtained as product of two balanced sequences u and v ,
where deg(u) = 2 and deg(v) = 3 (the previous example).
</p>
<p>Can all remaining balanced sequences w on four letters be
obtained as product u ⊗ v , where deg(u) = 2 and
deg(v) = 3?
