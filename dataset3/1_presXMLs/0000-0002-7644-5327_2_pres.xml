<p>Information about infectious crop diseases is vital in developing
countries. However, current survey methods are expensive,
limited, and slow: 2 months survey time + 3 months of data
entry.
</p>
<p>Ubiquity of mobile telephony in the developing world has
created opportunities for better systems...

<p>Outline of talk
</p>
<p>Three ways in which the utility of the survey can be further
improved with a fixed budget:
</p>
<p>Improvements in spatial disease estimation given
observations.
Adapting the locations to which surveyors should be sent,
given real-time survey updates.
Using computer vision to automatically diagnosis diseases
given camera-phone input.

<p>Density modelling problem
</p>
<p>In a crop disease survey, each plant is assigned a disease
level yi ∈ {d1, ...,dD}.
The observed data is of the form D = {xi ,yi |i = 1, . . . ,N}
where x 2i ∈ R is a spatial location.
We would like to infer P(y∗|x∗,D).
</p>
<p>Can then calculate things like incidence, the proportion of
infected plants: P(y∗ > d1|x∗).
</p>
<p>We should deal with the observations yi as ordinal
categories, d1 < d2 < · · ·< dD, and not code them as
numbers: we do not have a principled way of mapping
these categories to the real line, for example.
If possible, we should deal with observations in continuous
space, rather than losing information through aggregation.

</p>
<p>Survey utility
</p>
<p>Our goal is to come up with accurate estimates of the areas we
have not sampled directly. We have three principles, elicited
from our collaborators:
</p>
<p>1 Small errors are better than big errors.
2 It is more important to assess whether an area is diseased
</p>
<p>or not, than to accurately guess the specific severity.
3 Being wrongly optimistic—under-predicting the incidence
</p>
<p>of disease—is about twice as bad as being wrongly
pessimistic.

</p>
<p>Survey utility
</p>
<p>Our utility function, for guessing ŷ given truth y is
</p>
<p>uy (ŷ) =−OptimismFactor(y , ŷ) · (Error(y , ŷ) + DiseasePenalty(y , ŷ))
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>|y − ŷ |
Error(y , ŷ) ={ − ;D 1
</p>
<p>α y = 1 XOR ŷ = 1
DiseasePenalty(y , ŷ) ={ 0 otherwise;
</p>
<p>β y > ŷ
OptimismFactor(y , ŷ) =
</p>
<p>1 otherwise.

<p>Current spatial density model
</p>
<p>Example of current type of map generated by survey teams
(cassava brown streak disease, 2009):
</p>
<p>Densities are aggregated at district level. Two statistics are
calculated: incidence and severity.
</p>
<p>Other approaches in the literature: kriging (non-ordinal), MRFs
(discretized space).

</p>
<p>Gaussian process ordinal regression
</p>
<p>We can use GP regression with ordinal observed data to
model density in continuous space.
First, define a hidden function of the location f (xi), and
specify a covariance between the function at different
positions: (
</p>
<p>κ ( ) ( ) )
K (xi ,xj) = exp− x −x 2 22 i ,1 j ,1 + xi ,2−xj ,2
</p>
<p>Then relate the observations with this hidden function with
a likelihood term: p(yi |f (xi)).
We then integrate out f (xi) to obtain a distribution across
ordinal categories at each location.

<p>Survey site optimization
</p>
<p>Given real time updates using mobile phones as data
collection tools (more about this later), we can dynamically
change the survey plan according to which regions are
most interesting.
In the usual active learning setting, this is straightforward:
go to the places where the estimate is most uncertain.
We have an online variation of this problem: surveyors are
on a road circuit (represented as a 1D manifold R), and we
keep moving in the same direction.
Hence we will often prefer to sample a nearby point before
sampling a distant point, even if the latter is expected to be
more informative.
Currently, the survey plan is to sample at roughly equal
intervals along R.

<p>Image-based classification of disease
</p>
<p>One of the constraints on crop disease surveying currently
is the scarcity of experts.
When mobile data collection replaces paper-based
surveying, camera-phones can be used to collect image
data.
If we can use these images to perform a diagnosis of
disease automatically, then agricultural extension workers
with basic training can carry out the survey.

<p>Classification
</p>
<p>We classify using k-NN, where our distance is defined as an
average of distances between the two types of features.
</p>
<p>For hue histograms, the KL divergence is given by
</p>
<p>h
D h h h log 1,iKL( 1, 2) = ∑ 1,i .
</p>
<p>i h2,i
</p>
<p>For SIFT features, we calculate a mean µ and covariance Σ for
each image. The KL divergence for multivariate Gaussian
distributions is
</p>
<p>1 {
DKL(µ1,Σ1,µ2,Σ2) = tr(ace Σ Σ−1)+ Σ Σ−1−2I+2 1 2 2 1 }

<p>Summary
</p>
<p>We have introduced a density model, survey optimisation
method, and image-based disease classification method.
These techniques can bring significant savings in both
survey cost and time.
This also increases in the amount of data which can be
collected: extension workers can be issued with phones
and provide data year round.
We are planning national survey of cassava disease in
Uganda this year.
