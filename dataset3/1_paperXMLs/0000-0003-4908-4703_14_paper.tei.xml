The theorem has several variants, the strong and the weak variant are the two most well-known. The notion "the Hanani-Tutte theorem" refers to the strong variant.</p><p>Theorem 1 (The (strong) Hanani-Tutte theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>).

If a graph G has a drawing D in the plane where every pair of edges crosses an even number of times, then G has a crossing-free drawing in the plane that preserves the cyclic order of edges at each vertex of D.</p><p>The weak variant earned its name because of its stronger assumptions; however, it does not directly follow from the strong variant since its conclusion is stronger than just planarity of G. For sub-cubic graphs, the weak variant implies the strong variant, since in this case pairs of adjacent edges crossing oddly can be dealt with by a local redrawing in a small neighborhood of each vertex. See the survey by Schaefer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for a deeper historical overview and other variants of the Hanani-Tutte theorem.</p><p>Recently a common generalization of both the strong and the weak variant has been discovered.</p><p>Theorem 3 (Unified Hanani-Tutte theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>). Let G be a graph and let W be a subset of vertices of G. Let D be a drawing of G where every pair of edges that are independent or have a common endpoint in W cross an even number of times.

Pelsmajer, Schaefer andŠtefankovič <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> extended it further to arbitrary nonorientable surface.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Notation</head><p>Refer to the monograph by Mohar and Thomassen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for a detailed introduction into surfaces and graph embeddings. By a surface we mean a connected compact 2-dimensional topological manifold. Every surface is either orientable (has two sides) or nonorientable (has only one side). Every orientable surface S is obtained from the sphere by attaching g ≥ 0 handles, and this number g is called the genus of S. Similarly, every nonorientable surface S is obtained from the sphere by attaching g ≥ 0 crosscaps, and this number g is called the (nonorientable) genus of S. The simplest orientable surfaces are the sphere (with genus 0) and the torus (with genus 1). The simplest nonorientable surfaces are the projective plane (with genus 1) and the Klein bottle (with genus 2). We denote the orientable surface of genus g by M g .</p><p>We will also consider surfaces with holes: an orientable surface of genus g with k holes, denoted by M g,k , is obtained from M g by removing k disjoint open discs whose boundaries are also disjoint. The boundaries of the removed discs thus belong to M g,k and they are called the boundary components of M g,k .</p><p>Let G = (V, E) be a graph with no multiple edges and no loops, and let S be a surface or a surface with holes. A drawing of G on S is a representation of G where every vertex is represented by a unique point in S and every edge e joining vertices u and v is represented by a simple curve in S joining the two points that represent u and v. If it leads to no confusion, we do not distinguish between a vertex or an edge and its representation in the drawing and we use the words "vertex" and "edge" in both contexts. We require that in a drawing no edge passes through a vertex, no two edges touch, every edge has only finitely many intersection points with other edges and no three edges cross at the same inner point. In particular, every common point of two edges is either their common endpoint or a crossing.</p><p>A drawing of G on S is an embedding if no two edges cross. A face of an embedding of G on S is a connected component of the topological space obtained from S by removing all the edges and vertices of G. A 2-cell embedding is an embedding whose each face is homeomorphic to an open disc. In particular, a graph that has a 2-cell embedding must be connected, but not necessarily 2-connected.</p><p>The rotation of a vertex v in a drawing of G on an orientable surface is the clockwise cyclic order of the edges incident to v. We will represent the rotation of v by the cyclic order of the other endpoints of the edges incident to v. The rotation system of a drawing is the set of rotations of all vertices.</p><p>A facial walk corresponding to a face f in a 2-cell embedding of G on an orientable surface is the closed walk w(f ) in G with the following properties: the image of w in the embedding forms the boundary of f , and whenever w is entering a vertex v along an edge e, the next edge on w(f ) is the edge that immediately follows e in the rotation of v. In particular, while tracing the walk w(f ) in the embedding, the face f is always on the left-hand side.</p><p>The Euler characteristic of a surface S of genus g, denoted by χ(S), is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">χ(S) = 2 − 2g if S is orientable, and χ(S) = 2 − g if S is nonorientable. Equivalently, if v, e</formula><p>and f denote the number of vertices, edges and faces, respectively, of a 2-cell embedding of a graph on S, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">χ(S) = v − e + f .</formula><p>We say that two edges in a graph are independent if they do not share a vertex. An edge in a drawing is even if it crosses every other edge an even number of times. A vertex v in a drawing is even if all the edges incident to v cross each other an even number of times. A drawing of a graph is even if all its edges are even. A drawing of a graph is independently even if every pair of independent edges in the drawing crosses an even number of times.</p><p>The genus g(G) of a graph G is the minimum g such that G has an embedding on M g . The Z 2 -genus of a graph G is the minimum g such that G has an independently even drawing on M g .  and {B3, D3} cross once, but they are all adjacent with a common vertex outside W , the pairs {C1, B3} and {D2, B3} cross twice, and no other pair of edges has a common crossing. To verify condition 2), we use the fact that every vertex of W has the same rotation in D; namely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Let E be an embedding of G on an orientable surface S such that the rotation of every vertex from W is (1, 2, 3). Assume without loss of generality that S has minimum possible genus, which implies that E is a 2-cell embedding. Since G is bipartite, every face of E is bounded by a walk of even length. Moreover, we have the following crucial observation. Proof. Suppose that E has a face bounded by a walk v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 . Since G is 2-connected, the walk forms a 4-cycle in G. By symmetry, we may assume that v 1 , v 3 ∈ U and v 2 , v 4 ∈ W . It follows that in the rotation of v 2 , the vertex v 1 is immediately followed by v 3 , but in the rotation of v 4 the vertex v 3 is immediately followed by v 1 ; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Thus, the rotations of v 2 and v 4 cannot be the same, but this is a contradiction with the definition of E.</p><p>It follows that every face of E is bounded by a walk of length at least 6. Let v, e and f be the numbers of vertices, edges and faces, respectively, of E. We thus have 2e ≥ 6f , and so we can bound the Euler characteristic of S as follows: This implies that the genus of S is at least ⌈(2 + 1)/2⌉ = 2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ(S) = v − e + f = 1 3 (3v − 3e + 3f ) ≤ 1 3 (3v − 2e) = 1 3 (21 − 24) = −1.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Proof of Theorem 6</head><p>The proof is structured as follows. First we construct a graph K, by attaching 3K 1,4 to a large grid. Then we verify that K satisfies all the conditions of the theorem: it has an independently even drawing on M 4 , it has no embedding on M 4 , and it has an embedding on M 5 .</p><p>A construction of the graph K. Let G = K 3,4 , with parts U and W , be the graph from the previous subsection and let D be the drawing of G on the torus in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Cut a small circular hole around each vertex of W in D and place a new vertex on all twelve intersections of an edge of D and a boundary of a hole; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, left. In this way we obtain an independently even drawing D ′ of the disjoint union of three copies of K 1,4 on M 1,4 , the torus with four holes. We consider the three copies of K 1,4 colored black, red and blue. On each boundary component of M 1,4 , the clockwise order of the three vertices of D ′ is consistent with the rotations of the vertices of W in D: a black vertex is followed by a red vertex, which is followed by a blue vertex. Let N be a sufficiently large integer, and assume for convenience that N is divisible by 8. Let H be the N × N grid; that is, a graph with vertex set [N] × [N] and the edge set Grid embedding lemma. We use the following grid embedding lemma by Geelen, Richter and Salazar <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which states that in every embedding of a large grid on a surface of fixed genus, a large portion of the grid is embedded in a planar way. This also follows from earlier statements by <ref type="bibr">Thomassen [18,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 3.2]</ref> or Mohar <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 5.1]</ref>, and is implicit in the proof by Robertson and Seymour <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that each surface has only finitely many forbidden minors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">{{(i, j), (i ′ , j ′ )}; ((i = i ′ ) ∧ (j = j ′ + 1)) ∨ ((i = i ′ + 1) ∧ (j = j ′ ))}. Let</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 10 ([6, Lemma 4]).</head><p>Suppose that H is an N × N grid embedded on M g , and let t, k be positive integers such that N ≥ t(k + 1) and t 2 ≥ 2g + 1. Then a k × k subgrid H ′ of H is embedded in a topological disc in M g whose boundary is formed by the boundary</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">4(k − 1)-cycle of H ′ .</formula><p>The idea of the proof of Lemma 10 is roughly the following. It is enough to show that in every embedding of the grid H on M g , the number of noncontractible 4-cycles of H is bounded by a function of g; in this case linear in g. This is a consequence of an elementary topological result stating that a collection C of disjoint noncontractible closed curves in M g that appears on the boundary of a common component of M g \ C, has cardinality at most 2g. Indeed, such a collection cannot contain three pairwise homotopic curves, and a collection of pairwise disjoint pairwise nonhomotopic noncontractible closed curves in M g has cardinality at most g, which can be shown by induction on g.</p><p>The graph K has no embedding on M 4 . Let K be an embedding of K on an orientable surface S of minimum possible genus; in particular, K is a 2-cell embedding.</p><p>Let H 0 be a subgraph of H induced by the the vertices (N ∩ [3N/8, 5N/8]) × (N ∩ [3N/8, 5N/8]). The graph H 0 is a square grid, sufficiently far from the special 4-cycles and from the boundary of H if N is large enough. We use Lemma 10 for the induced embedding of H 0 with k ≥ 5. Let H ′ be the resulting square grid and let D ′ ⊂ S be the smallest topological closed disc containing the image of H ′ in K. We chose k ≥ 5 so that H ′ has at least 16 vertices on its perimeter, which is sufficient for our next construction, although in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> we draw a slightly larger grid.</p><p>Using the embedding K and the disc D ′ we construct an embedding E ′ of G ′ = K 4,5 on S; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. Let V (G ′ ) = U ′ ∪ W ′ where U ′ and W ′ are independent sets of size 5 and 4, respectively, and U ′ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We will refer to the vertices 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 together with their incident edges as black, red, blue, green and yellow, respectively. We identify the vertices 1, 2, 3 of U ′ with the vertices 1, 2, 3, respectively, of K. We place the green vertex 4 in H so that it is sufficiently far from H ′ , from the four special 4-cycles, and from the boundary of H. We place the yellow vertex 5 and all the four vertices of W ′ inside D ′ ; not necessarily coinciding with any vertices of K.</p><p>We draw the black, red and blue edges of G ′ along the edges of K incident with vertices 1, 2 and 3, respectively, so that they reach the special 4-cycles in H. Then we extend these twelve edges using vertex-disjoint paths in H, until they reach the boundary of D ′ . We draw the last portions of these edges inside D ′ , without having to use the embedding K. Due to the planarity of H, the cyclic orders of the colored vertices on the boundaries of the special 4-cycles are "linked" by the black, red and blue edges to opposite cyclic orders around the vertices of W ′ inside D ′ ; in particular, the rotation of each vertex of W ′ in the constructed drawing contains the cyclic subsequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Moreover, we can make sure that the black and blue edges, incident to the vertices 1 and 3, respectively, are "accessible" from the boundary of H, while the red edges are "hidden". We proceed similarly with the green edges, which are drawn from the green vertex 4 along vertex-disjoint paths of H (and disjoint from the black, red and blue edges drawn previously) until they reach the boundary of D ′ , and continue inside D ′ . Such vertex-disjoint paths supporting the black, red, blue and green edges exist since the degree of the vertex 4 in H is 4 and the disc D ′ , the special 4-cycles, the boundary of H, and the vertex 4 are all sufficiently far from each other in H. The yellow edges are drawn completely inside D ′ . The crucial property that we satisfy is that the rotations of the four vertices in W ′ are all equal to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. This implies the following observation, analogous to Observation 8 in the previous subsection.</p><p>Observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref>. No face of E ′ is bounded by a walk of length shorter than 10. In fact, the length of each facial walk in E ′ is divisible by 10.</p><p>Proof. Since E ′ is an embedding on an orientable surface, whenever we trace a facial walk in the counterclockwise direction, an edge from i ∈ U ′ to w ∈ W ′ must be followed by the edge from w to i + 1 (taken modulo 5).</p><p>Let v, e and f be the numbers of vertices, edges and faces, respectively, of E ′ . By Observation 11, we have 2e ≥ 10f , and so we can bound the Euler characteristic of S as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">χ(S) = v − e + f = 1 5 (5v − 5e + 5f ) ≤ 1 5 (5v − 4e) = 1 5 (45 − 80) = −7.</formula><p>This implies that the genus of S is at least ⌈(2+7)/2⌉ = 5. Therefore, K has no embedding on M 4 .</p><p>The graph K has an embedding on M 5 . First we describe an embedding of G on M 2 where the rotations of the four vertices A, B, C, D in W are equal. We can embed G so that the rotation of each vertex in W is (1, 2, 3), the rotation of 1 is <ref type="figure">(C, A, B, D)</ref>, and the rotations of both 2 and 3 are <ref type="figure">(A, B, C, D)</ref>. This embedding has three faces, with facial walks of lengths 6, 6 and 12. By Euler's formula, this rotation system indeed gives an embedding on M 2 . An embedding of K on M 5 is obtained by an analogous gluing operation as the drawing in Claim 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Consequences</head><p>Using the additivity of the genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the Z 2 -genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> of a graph over its components, by taking the disjoint union of the graph K from Theorem 6 with k copies of K 5 we obtain a counterexample to an extension of the strong Hanani-Tutte theorem on an arbitrary orientable surface of genus larger than 4. Moreover, by taking k disjoint copies of K, we obtain a separation of the genus and the Z 2 -genus by a multiplicative factor of 5/4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related questions and open problems</head><p>Schaefer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> introduced the following weaker variant of the strong Hanani-Tutte theorem, parametrized by a positive integer t.</p><p>Conjecture 13 ([15, Conjecture 3.3]). If a graph G has an independently even drawing on a surface S such that every pair of edges crosses at most t times, then G has an embedding on S.</p><p>The drawing on M 4 constructed in Claim 9 disproves Conjecture 13 for t = 2 and orientable surfaces of genus at least 4. The conjecture remains open for t = 1. In this case, only adjacent edges of G are allowed to cross in the initial drawing. In fact, the following question, often expressed as "do adjacent crossings mater?", is open. Problem 14. Let S be a surface other than the plane or the projective plane. Assume that a graph G has a drawing on S where only adjacent edges are allowed to cross. Does G have an embedding on S? Problem 14 can also be formulated in terms of the independent crossing number of G on S, which may be denoted by cr −S (G) using the notation in Schaefer's survey on crossing numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For a given surface S, Problem 14 then asks whether cr −S (G) = 0 implies cr S (G) = 0.</p><p>The strong Hanani-Tutte theorem and its possible generalizations can be weakened in several other ways. For example, instead of an independently even drawing of G we may consider the edges of G oriented and require a drawing of G where for every pair of independent edges e and f , the number of crossings in which e crosses f from the left is equal to the number of crossings in which e crosses f from the right. This can be formulated in terms of the independent algebraic crossing number of G on S, denoted by iacr S (G) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which is well-defined on orientable surfaces. For the graph K from the proof of Theorem 6 we can only show that iacr M 4 (K) ≤ 2. In the drawing of K from Claim 9, there are three pairs of adjacent edges such that for each of the pairs, the union of the two edges contains a noncontractible curve. Can this be avoided in a counterexample? This question was suggested to us by Jeff Erickson.</p><p>Problem 16. Let S be a surface other than the plane or the projective plane. Assume that a graph G has an independently even drawing on S where the union of every pair of adjacent edges can be covered by a topological disc.

Choose four special 4-cycles in H that are sufficiently separated from each other and also from the boundary of the grid; for example, the 4-cycles with bottom left corners at (N/4, N/4), (3N/4, N/4), (N/4, 3N/4) and (3N/4, 3N/4). See Figure 3, right. For each of these special 4-cycles in H, remove its interior from the plane, select three of its vertices, and mark them as black, blue, and red in clockwise order. We can now regard H as an embedding of H on M 0,4 . Let K be the graph obtained from H by adding three vertices, labeled by 1, 2 and 3, each of degree 4, with vertex 1 joined by an edge to each black vertex in H, vertex 2 joined to each red vertex in H, and vertex 3 joined to each blue vertex in H. Claim 9. The graph K has an independently even drawing on M 4 .Proof. Such a drawing is obtained by gluing the drawings D ′ and H along the four boundary components of M 1,4 and M 0,4 , respectively, in such a way that pairs of vertices of the same color are identified.</figDesc></figure>
