(Strong) Hanani-Tutte theorem on the projective plane: (Pelsmajer-Schaefer-Stasi, 2009; Colin de Verdière-Kaluža-Paták-Patáková-Tancer, 2016) If a graph G has an independently even drawing on the projective plane, then G has an embedding on the projective plane.

Partial answer: No to the orientable surface of genus 4 or larger (Fulek-K., 2017) Theorem: (Böhme-Kawarabayashi-Maharry-Mohar, 2008) For every positive integer t, every sufficiently large 7-connected graph contains K 3,t as a minor. Generalization: (Böhme-Kawarabayashi-Maharry-Mohar, 2009) -larger connectivity and K a,t minors for every fixed a &gt; 3.</figDesc></figure>
