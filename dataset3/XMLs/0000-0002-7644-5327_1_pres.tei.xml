either analytic or using e.g. approach described above is decision-theoretic • What if we want to take a game-theoretic approach?-Athey &amp; Haile [2000] discuss estimation in the game theoretic setting • however, they generally assume that number of bidders is known -let f(v) be the distribution of bidder's valuations (instead of bid amounts) • g(m) remains the distribution of number of bidders, as before -given a bidder's valuation v, what is his bid amount? • solve for Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the auction game: bid function b(v |f, g) • EM algorithm to estimate f and g in a GT setting: -E step: for each sample given observation x o : • sample m from g'(m | m ≥ n) • compute observed bidders' valuations v o from x o by inverting the bid function • generate new bidders with valuations v h who place hidden bids x h = b(v h |f', g') -generate mn + 1 bids, keeping samples when exactly one hidden bid is higher than the highest observed bid -M step: update f' and g' to maximize likelihood of the valuations v o ∪ v h sequential, single-good online auctions for possibly non-identical goods -we want only one item • e.g. buying a Playstation 2 from eBay, where such auctions are held regularly -denote our valuation for the item in auction j as v j and our bid as b j -let U j denote expected payoff at time j, conditional on not having won already • a function of our valuations for the goods in the auctions j, …, k • Consider the construction of a decision-theoretic agent to participate in a finite sequence of auctions (under our online auction model) -given estimates f'(v) and g'(m), what are the optimal bidding strategies?• Greenwald &amp;
