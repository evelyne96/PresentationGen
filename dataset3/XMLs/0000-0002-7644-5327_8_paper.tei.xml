<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In combinatorial auctions, multiple goods are sold simultaneously and bidders are allowed to place bids on bundles, rather than just on individual goods. These auctions have been widely studied in the last decade, with the ultimate goal of better allocating scarce resources among bidders who value them non-additively (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>). When designing a combinatorial auction mechanism, one may desire that it satisfy various different properties. One important property is that it be a dominant strategy for selfish bidders to truthfully reveal their private information to the mechanism. * Dept. <ref type="bibr">of</ref>  Quite a lot of work in the literature is concerned with the design of strategyproof mechanisms for combinatorial auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>. Another important class of properties concerns an auction's revenue. An auction mechanism is called optimal if it maximizes the expected revenue.</p><p>Optimal auctions were originally studied in the context of single-good auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. More recent work has extended these ideas to design multi-unit or multi-good auctions that offer strong revenue guarantees, usually achieving a constant fraction of the optimal revenue <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>. We are concerned with describing the way an auction's revenue changes with the number of participating bidders. Intuitively, one might expect that revenue weakly increases as the number of bidders grows, as competition also increases. We say that an auction mechanism is revenue monotonic when this intuition is correct: the seller's revenue is guaranteed to weakly increase as bidders are added.Groves mechanisms in general and VCG in particular have gained substantial attention because they are the only strategyproof mechanisms that guarantee efficient allocations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. However, VCG has also received numerous criticisms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>). One of these problems is that VCG is not revenue monotonic for bidders (unless bidders' valuations are restricted; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>). Following an example due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, consider an auction with three bidders and two goods for sale. Suppose that bidder 2 wants both goods for the price of $2 billion whereas bidder 1 and bidder 3 are willing to pay $2 billion for the first and the second good respectively. The VCG mechanism awards the goods to bidders 1 and 3 for the price of zero, yielding the seller zero revenue. However, in the absence of either bidder 1 or bidder 3, the revenue of the auction would be $2 billion. In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> we showed that this problem is not restricted to VCG. Instead, we proved that no revenue monotonic mechanism exists in a very broad class of deterministic, strategyproof combinatorial auction mechanisms. We define this setting and class of mechanisms in Section 2, and also state our impossibility result. Here, we note two lines of research that are closely related to our own past work. First, Day and Milgrom <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref> used coalitional game theory to investigate revenue monotonicity in the context of efficient mechanisms. Second, Yokoo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> investigated false-name bidding; however, their proof can also be understood as showing that revenue monotonicity fails in ef-ficient strategyproof mechanisms. In contrast, we do not restrict ourselves to efficient mechanisms.</p><p>There are many cases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>) in which randomized mechanisms are able to achieve desirable properties that cannot be obtained by deterministic mechanisms. In Section 3 we define randomized mechanisms and some desirable properties for our setting. In Section 4 we show that it is possible to circumvent our impossibility result, at least for known single-minded bidders, by proposing a class of combinatorial auction mechanisms that we call "stepwise" randomized combinatorial auction mechanisms. We also show how to construct such revenue-monotonic mechanisms, though this construction can sometimes require exponential time. Finally, in Section 5 we give a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing our mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Deterministic Mechanisms</head><p>To prove results about revenue monotonicity, we need to reason about the behaviour of combinatorial auction mechanisms when bidders are added or dropped. We also need to reason about mechanisms whose behavior can depend on bidder preferences-for example, each bidder may have a "single-minded" interest in one particular bundle. For these reasons, we provide a set of general definitions in which the allocation of goods and the payments imposed may depend on which bidders participate and which goods are for sale, as well as on bidders' declared preferences.</p><p>Let N = {1, . . . , n} be the universal set of n biddersall the potential bidders who exist in the world. Let N ⊆ N denote the set of bidders participating in a particular auction. Let G be the finite universe of goods for sale. Let G ⊆ G denote the set of goods for sale in a particular auction. Let both N and G be common knowledge among all bidders and the auctioneer.</p><p>A valuation function describes the values that a bidder holds for subsets of the set of goods in G. Let valuation function v G,i for bidder i ∈ N map 2 G to the nonnegative reals. For every G ⊂ G let valuation function v G,i be the projection of v G,i into G. Whenever G is understood, we drop it from the subscript. We assume that bidders have quasilinear utility functions; that is, bidder i's utility for bundle a i is v i (a i ) − p i , where v i is her valuation and p i is any payment she is required to make.</p><p>A valuation profile is an n-tuple v = (v 1 , . . . , v n ), where, for every participating bidder i, v i is a valuation function. Let V denote the universal set of all possible valuation profiles. Observe that valuation profiles always have one entry for every potential bidder, regardless of the number of bidders who participate in the auction. We use the symbol ∅ in such tuples as a placeholder for each nonparticipating bidder (i.e., each bidder i ∈ N ). When v is an n-dimensional tuple, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(v 1 , . . . , v i−1 , ∅, v i+1 , . . . , v n ) is denoted by v −i . Note that if i ∈ N , then v = v −i . Let V N,G denote</formula><p>the set of all valuation profiles given a set of participating bidders N and a set of goods for sale G; that is, the set of all valuation profiles v G for which v i = ∅ if and only if i ∈ N .</p><p>If asked to reveal her valuation, a bidder may not tell the truth. Denote the declared valuation function of a (participating) bidder i asv i . Letv be the declared valuation profile. Use the same notation to describe declared valuation profiles as valuation profiles (e.g., all declared valuation profiles are n-tuples), and furthermore write</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(v i ,v −i ) to denote (v 1 , . . . ,v i−1 , v i ,v i+1 , . . . ,v n ).</formula><p>In a particular auction, bidders' valuation functions may be drawn from some restricted set. For example, we will need to make such an assumption to model known singleminded bidders. Let V N,G ⊆ V N,G denote a subspace of the universal set of valuation profiles for the set of participating bidders N and the set of goods for sale G. (For example, all valuations consistent with each bidder having a singleminded interest in one known bundle.) Let V N,G denote the universal set of valuation profile subspaces, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V N,G = {V N,G N ⊆ N, G ⊆ G, V N,G ⊆ V N,G }. Let V denote a</formula><p>set of valuation profile subspaces with at least one member corresponding any N ⊆ N and G ⊆ G. That is, V ⊆ V N,G and ∃V N,G ∈ V, ∀N ⊆ N, G ⊆ G. (For example, subspaces corresponding to all the possible sets of known bundles for different bidders.) Note that there could be more than one subspace corresponding to a fixed N and a fixed G in V. • a, the allocation scheme, maps eachv ∈ V N,G to an allocation tuple a = (a 1 (v), . . . , a n (v)) of goods,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">where ∪ i a i (v) ⊆ G, a i (v) ∩ a j (v) = ∅ if i ≠ j, and a i (v) = ∅ ifv i = ∅.</formula><p>• p, the payment scheme, maps eachv ∈ V N,G to a payment tuple p = (p 1 (v), . . . , p n (v)), where p i (v) is the payment from bidder i to the auctioneer such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p i (v) = 0 ifv i = ∅.</formula><p>We refer to a i and p i as bidder i's allocation and payment functions respectively. Wheneverv can be understood from the context, we refer to a i (v) and p i (v) by a i and p i , respectively. Ifv i (a i ) &gt; 0, we say that bidder i "wins". We denote by A G the set of all possible partitions of G into n partitions; i.e. the set of all possible ways of distributing goods among participating bidders. For any given allocation a ∈ A G , we denote by a i the set of goods that are allocated to bidder i under a.</p><p>Mechanisms that give rise to dominant strategies are especially desirable, as bidders are spared having to reason about each others' behavior. A direct CA mechanism is said to be truthful if in equilibrium bidders declare their true valuations to the mechanism. A direct CA mechanism is said to be strategyproof (or dominant strategy truthful) if every bidder has the dominant strategy of revealing her true preferences.</p><p>The revenue of an auction is the sum of payments made to the auctioneer. Informally, an auction mechanism is revenue monotonic if the auctioneer could never increase revenue by dropping a bidder.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">DEFINITION 2.2. (REVENUE MONOTONICITY) A truthful CA mechanism M is revenue monotonic if and only if for all N ⊆ N, G ⊆ G, V N,G ∈ V, v ∈ V N,G and for all bidders j, i∈N p i (v) ≥ i∈N∖{j} p i (v −j ).</formula><p>It is natural, and commonly assumed, that a bidder should make no payment to the mechanism unless she wins. We call this assumption participation. A mechanism is weakly maximal with respect to a bidder i if, whenever i values any good g sufficiently, the mechanism does not withhold that good or give it away to a bidder who does not value it. (For formal definitions see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.)</p><p>Our main results refer to a restricted class of valuation spaces: known single-minded bidders. Our definition of this class follows Mu'alem and Nisan <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and Nisan <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Informally, a participating bidder i is single-minded if she only values bundles that contain a particular bundle b i , and she values all these bundles equally. Thus, i's valuation function v i maps supersets of b i to some positive value v i and maps all other bundles to 0. A mechanism is defined for known single-minded bidders if all bidders are singleminded and furthermore, the mechanism "knows" the bundle b i that is valued by each participating bidder i. Thus, bidder i can lie about her value (declare av i ≠ v i ), but does not even have to declare her bundle of interest b i , and hence cannot lie about it.</p><p>More formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">let b = (b 1 , b 2 , . . . , b n ) ∈ (2 G ) n .

Thus, V (b)</formula><p>N,G is simply the space of valuation profiles in which participating bidders are all single-minded, with the bundle valued by participating bidder i being b i .</p><p>Let V (ksm) denote the set of valuation profile subspaces for known single-minded bidders; that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V (ksm) = {V (b) N,G N ⊆ N, G ⊆ G, b ∈ (2 G ) n }.</formula><p>We say that a mechanism is defined for known single-minded bidders if its set of valuation profile subspaces is V (ksm) . From the definition of mechanism (Definition 2.1), it follows that the allocation and payment functions depend on the set V The valuation of a known single-minded bidder can be characterized by the single parameter v i , representing i's valuation for any superset of bundle b i . Thus in this case we use v to denote single-minded bidders' valuation profile, v i to denote the declared valuation of a participating bidder i, andv to denote a tuple consisting of declared valuations for each participating bidder and ∅ symbols for each nonparticipating bidder.</p><p>Roughly speaking, a mechanism defined for known single-minded bidders satisfies consumer sovereignty if by bidding high enough, any bidder can win the bundle she values-more formally, given any bidder i and the declared values of the other bidders,v −i , there exists some finite</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">amount k i ∈ R, k i &gt; 0, such that if i reportsv i = k i then i is allocated at least b i .</formula><p>In our past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>, we proved an impossibility result: there is no deterministic combinatorial auction mechanism that satisfies our desirable properties. To obtain as strong a result as possible, we proved that the result is true even when the bidders are known single-minded. THEOREM 2.1. Let G ≥ 2 and N ≥ 3. Let M be a CA mechanism defined for known single-minded bidders that offers dominant strategies to bidders and satisfies participation, consumer sovereignty, and weak maximality with respect to at least two bidders. Then M is not revenue monotonic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Randomized Mechanisms</head><p>In this work, we study the consequences of relaxing the assumption that mechanisms are deterministic. More specifically, we ask whether there are revenue monotonic randomized mechanisms that satisfy our desired properties. (As we will see, moving to the randomized case will also require reinterpretations of these properties, particularly of consumer sovereignty.) As the following definition states, a randomized CA mechanism produces a distribution over allocations and payments. Given V N,G ∈ V, let π a (v ) denote the probability that allocation a ∈ A G will be chosen given declared valuesv . Let p i (v ) denote the expected payment of i.</p><p>A randomized CA mechanism is strategyproof in expectation if and only if truth-telling is a dominant strategy for all bidders in the game induced by expectation.</p><p>Randomized mechanisms can be defined for known single-minded bidders in a manner analogous to that used for deterministic mechanisms above.

Next we define maximality for randomized CA mechanisms. Our definition here is stronger (more general) than the weak maximality definition we provided for deterministic mechanisms. We chose to use weak maximality in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> because it strengthened our impossibility result stated there. For randomized mechanisms, we will prove a positive result, namely the existence of revenue monotonic randomized mechanisms with several desired properties. To make our positive result as strong as possible, we use a more general notion of maximality here. Informally, a mechanism is maximal with respect to a bidder i if, whenever i values any subset of goods s (rather than a single good g) sufficiently, the mechanism does not withhold that bundle or give the goods in the bundle away to bidders who do not value them. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">THEOREM 3.1.

An allocation a is maximal if it satisfies either <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref> for all bidders i. A randomized CA mechanism M satisfies maximality if any allocation with positive support under M is maximal.</p><p>It is somewhat harder to decide how to extend our consumer sovereignty definition to randomized mechanisms for known single-minded bidders. We first consider two possible extensions to the definition for deterministic mechanisms, which can be seen as opposite extremes. First, we could define consumer sovereignty (I) as requiring that, fixing bids of the others, any bidder is able to win any desired bundle with probability one if she bids high enough. Unfortunately, in this case we recover our previous impossibility result. On the other hand, we could define consumer sovereignty (II) as requiring that any bidder be able to win any desired bundle with some probability above zero if she bids high enough. This leads to a different problem. Consider a mechanism M with α N,G,i,s = 0 that chooses a maximal allocation uniformly at random, and charges nothing. Note that each bidder wins her desired bundle in at least one maximal allocation. Therefore, it is easy to verify that M is strategyproof and satisfies participation, consumer sovereignty, and maximality with respect to all bidders. It also is revenue monotonic since it never collects any money.</p><p>The above arguments suggest that we ought to seek an intermediate definition for consumer sovereignty. We thus present the following definition, which roughly requires that, given the valuations of the other bidders, a bidder who starts bidding at 0 and then raises her bid can increase her probability of winning by at least δ at least γ times. DEFINITION 3.5. ((γ-STEP, δ) CONSUMER SOVEREIGNTY) A randomized CA mechanism defined for known single-minded bidders satisfies (γ-step, δ) consumer sovereignty, γ ≥ 0 and δ &gt; 0, iff for any fixed tuple of bundles b = (b 1 , . . . , b n ) and for some constants</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">0 = c i,0 &lt; c i,1 &lt; . . . &lt; c i,γ &lt; c i,γ+1 = ∞, ∀i ∈ N, the following holds. For all N ⊆ N, G ⊆ G, bidder i ∈ N , v −i ∈ V (b) N,G −i</formula><p>, and j &lt; γ, we have that: the winning probabilities, w i 's, are monotonic and furthermore either</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">w i (c i,si+1 ,v −i ) ≥ w i (c i,si ,v −i ) + δ or w i (c i,si+1 ,v −i ) = 1.</formula><p>It is easy to see that if a mechanism satisfies (γ-step, δ) consumer sovereignty for some γ = k, it then also satisfies (γ-step, δ) consumer sovereignty for any γ for which 0 ≤ γ ≤ k. Observe that the constants c i,si are independent of all bidders' declared valuations; in a sense, they can be seen as "bidder-specific, leveled reserve prices." Thus, while we do not assume that the mechanism designer knows anything about the valuation distribution(s), if such information is available, it can be useful for setting these constants.</p><p>We now propose a simple and useful class of randomized mechanisms. These define the probability that any given bidder wins as a stepwise function of her bid amount, with a finite number of steps. </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">i &lt; c i,si+1 , it is the case that w N,ℓ (v i ,v −i ) = w N,ℓ (c i,si ,v −i ), for all ℓ ∈ N .</formula><p>We call the mechanism a γ-step randomized mechanism if it satisfies the above for k = γ.</p><p>A γ-step randomized mechanism can be interpreted as a mechanism that for each bidder i, cares only about specific declared values, c i,0 , c i,1 , . . . , c i,γ and treats any declared value of i between c i,si and c i,si+1 the same as c i,si . In fact, one can easily verify that w i (v ) = w i (c 1,s1 , . . . , c n,sn ), for allv where c i,si ≤v i &lt; c i,si+1 for all participating bidders i. If a γ-step randomized mechanism additionally has the following monotonicity property that either <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">w i (c i,si ,v −i ) + δ ≤ w i (c i,si+1 ,v −i ), or (2) w i (c i,si+1</formula><p>,v −i ) = 1, then the mechanism satisfies (γ-step, δ) consumer sovereignty. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 1</ref> shows a sample w i for a 6-step stepwise randomized mechanism, given fixed bids by the other bidders. Observe that, by Theorem 3.1, if the mechanism is to satisfy strategyproofness and participation, our choice of w i must imply a specific choice of p i . Here, if the bidder declareŝ v i , she must pay an amount equal to the area of the shaded region. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Feasibility program</head><p>Observe that a mechanism is a mapping from declared valuations to allocation probabilities π a 's and payments p i 's. Here we express such a mapping as a solution to a set of feasibility programs (albeit ones with N,G . Observe that because this last set is (uncountably) infinite, the feasibility program involves an infinite number of both variables and constraints. some nonlinear constraints, and an uncountably infinite number of both variables and constraints). Recall that any CA mechanism defined for known single-minded bidders is able to condition its behavior on G, N , and V (b) N,G (see Definition 2.1). Because the mechanism is free to behave differently for every G (available set of goods) and V (b) N,G (set of known bundles of interest for the bidders), we write a separate feasibility program for each possible joint assignment to these variables. Our feasibility program, denoted F and given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2</ref>, is thus parameterized by V N,G (i.e., it knows the bundles of nonparticipating bidders).

Let GR N be a graph of (γ + 1) N nodes, each corresponding to a different potential declared valuation profile of bidders in ◻ V (b) N,G . Let there be a directed edge between each pair of nodes that differ in only one of the bidders' declarations, and in which this difference is an increase of exactly one step (i.e., from c i,si to c i,si+1 ). In other words, we can move from one node to another by increasing one bidder's bid by one step. If an edge indicates an increase in bidder i's declared value, we say the edge is of type e i . Now, assign M N labels to each edge, one for each allocation in M N . Allocation a's label on an edge of type e i denotes the change to π N,a by moving along an edge of type e i (which increases bidder i's bid amount by one step) and is equal to q N,a,i ⋅ δ. Define the cost of a path as the absolute value of the sum of the labels of the edges in the path. Proof. For all i ∈ N , the number of edges of type e i is the same in all paths between s and t. Since all edges of type e i have the same label corresponding to allocation a, the sum of a's associated labels along any path between s and t is equal to π N,a (t) − π N,a (s). ◻ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Figure 4</ref> represents GR N for S 3,2 . On each edge, the label corresponding to a 1,3 -which denotes the change in π N,a1,3 due to moving along the edge-is equal to q N,a1,3,i ⋅δ for some i ∈ N and is exactly the negative of the label corresponding to a 2 . The the cost of the longest path (e.g., between (c 1,0 , c 2,γ , c 3,0 ) and (c 1,γ , c 2,0 , c 3,γ )) is 3γδ. Now let us move to the proof of our general result.

Precisely, (i) (F.a 1 ) is induced by (4.2), (P.π 1 ) and (P.π 2 ); (ii) (F.a 2 ) is induced by (4.2) (P.π 1 ) and (P.π 3 ); (iii) (F.max) is induced by (4.2) and (P.π 1 )-this simply follows the fact that any a ∉ M N is certainly not in M N ; (iv) (F.w) is induced by (4.3); and (v) (F.step) is induced by (4.2) and (4.3).</p><p>(F.mon) is induced by (P.π 1 ), (P.π 3 ), (P.π 4 ), (P.q 1 )-(P.q 4 ), (4.2) and <ref type="bibr">(4.3)</ref>. To see this, note that we can write w N,i (v ) = ∑ a∈A G ,ai⊇bi π N,a (c 1,s1 , . . . , c n,sn ) = ∑ a∈M,ai=bi (π N,a (0)+∑ ℓ∈N (q N,a,ℓ ⋅δ⋅s ℓ )). The first equality follows from (4.2) and (4.3) and the second equality follows from (P.π 1 ) and (P.π 4 ). Now, if (1) a i = b i , ∀a ∈ M N , then, w N,i (v ) = ∑ a∈M,ai=bi π N,a (0) = 1. The first equality holds by (P.q 1 ) and the second equality holds by (P.π 3 ). Otherwise, letv ′ = (v ′ i ,v −i ). Then w N,i (v ′ ) − w N,i (v ) = ∑ a∈M N ,ai=bi (q N,a,i ⋅δ⋅(s ′ i −s i )) = δ⋅(s ′ i −s i ). The first equality holds by (P.π 4 ) and the second equality holds by (P.q 4 ). Now, ifv i ≤v ′ i then s i ≤ s ′ i and thus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref> w N,i (v ) ≤ w N,i (v ′ ).

Following the same argument as above, if a i = b i , ∀a ∈ M N , then, w N,i (v ) = ∑ a∈M,ai=bi π N,a (0) = 1. Otherwise, w N,i (c i,si+1 ,v −i ) − w N,i (c i,si ,v −i ) = δ. Thus we get (F.cs).</p><p>(F.sp) is induced by (F.step) and <ref type="bibr">(4.4)</ref>.

As stated above, if bidder i belongs to all a ∈ M N , then ∀v , w N,i (v ) = 1 and thus p N,i (v ) = 0. Otherwise, p N,i (v ) = ∑ 1≤s ′ i ≤si ci,s i ≤vi&lt;ci,s i +1 c i,s ′ i ⋅ δ. By Lemma 4.1, it is clear that dropping bidder j ≠ i either does not change the payment of bidder i or sets it to zero (if dropping j entails a case in which i belongs to all the allocation in the support of the mechanism). Thus (F.rm) follows immediately. N,G , G) are all linear or quadratic, and so our problem of identifying mechanism M γ can be reduced to solving a set of quadratically constrained linear programs where the objective function in each is to maximize δ, and then checking each for δ &gt; 0. However, we can do even better. The next result demonstrates that this QCLP is always feasible; later, we will show how to analytically construct a solution with δ &gt; 0. N,G , G) be given.

It is easy to verify that regardless of V</p><p>N,G and G we can always generate π N,a (0)'s such that ∑ a∈M N π N,a (0) = 1. For example, we can set π N,a (0) = 1 M N . In fact, there are infinitely many such assignments of π N,a (0)'s. Similarly, there exist infinitely many random assignments of the q N,a,i 's that satisfy (P.q 1 )-(P.q 5 ). Now note that except for δ, P (V In the example, it is clear that 3γδ ≤ 1 and thus δ ≤ 1 3γ . Since we have complete freedom in choosing π N,a (0)'s, we can set them appropriately-that is to set π N,a1,3 (0) = 1 3 and π N,a2 (0) = 2 3-so that δ = 1 3γ is feasible. As we said earlier, we described the solution of S 3,2 for N = N and G = G. To fully define the mechanism we simply have to find δ for all choices for N and G and keep the smallest δwhich indeed is δ = 1 3γ . Our QCLP formulation characterizes a class of randomized mechanisms that satisfy our desired properties. However, a mechanism designer may also hope to optimize some additional objective function such as social welfare or revenue. In our construction above, we have full or partial freedom to set δ, M N , π N,a , and q N,a,i . Here, we briefly discuss tuning δ; we leave further investigations of optimization for future work.</p><p>Fixing M N 's, π N,a 's and q N,a,i 's, we obtain a strategyproof mechanism, which yields the same social welfare no matter how we set δ. This is because the social welfare depends only on the allocation and bidders' true valuations. Since fixed sets of M N 's and π N,a 's always produce the same distribution over the allocation space, the social welfare is always the same in expectation regardless of δ. On the other hand, δ does affect payments; indeed, the maximum δ maximizes revenue. Furthermore, the bigger δ is, the stronger is the consumer sovereignty guarantee offered to bidders. Thus maximizing δ offers (different) benefits both to the auctioneer and to bidders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">A Polynomial Time Algorithm</head><p>At first glance, it may seem that constructing M γ requires time exponential in the number of potential bidders N and goods G, since P has an exponential number of variables and constraints. As the example S 3,2 in Section 4 shows, some settings are "easy to solve" because of their special bidderbundle structure that let us circumvent the exponential nature of the problem. It turns out that, even in the general case, we can always construct M N for all V Steps 1-3 take O( N G log( G )) time and we have to run them at most N times, since in each run at least one bidder is marked as "awarded". Thus, the algorithm take time O( N 2 G log( G )) to run. We add one allocation to M N at the end of each run; thus M N is of size O( N ). ◻ Unfortunately, finding a desirable solution among the set of feasible solutions-e.g. a solution that maximizes δ-can be complicated and dependent on the architecture of the given bidder-bundle setting, our choice of M N 's and the other parameters. However, we can construct a feasible solution in polynomial time giving a (loose) lower bound on the maximum δ that satisfies our constraints. Therefore, 1 n ≤ q N,a,i ≤ 1. Let π N,a = 1 M N . Therefore, 1 n ≤ π N,a ≤ 1 2 . Consider the combination of constraints (P.π 2 ) and (P.π 4 ) in the form we presented in the proof of Lemma 4.5. That is δ ≤ −π N,a (0) ta if t a &lt; 0, and δ ≤ 1−π N,a (0) ta if t a &gt; 0, where t a = ∑ i∈N (q N,a,i ⋅ s i ). By our choice of π N,a 's and q N,a,i 's in above, −π N,a (0) ta ≥ 1 n 2 γ and 1−π N,a (0) ta ≥ 1 2nγ . Thus, max(δ) ≥ min{ 1 n 2 γ , 1 2nγ } = 1 n 2 γ . ◻</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this work, we showed that our previous impossibility result about deterministic, strategyproof, revenue monotonic CA mechanisms can be circumvented by stepwise randomized mechanisms. In future work, we intend to investigate whether our mechanisms can be extended to unknown singleminded bidders and other variations in the auction setting.</p><p>We also intend to explore connections to the core and to falsename bidding, and to identify stepwise randomized mechanisms that maximize objective functions of interest. Furthermore, we aim to further investigate maximizing δ; we conjecture that δ cannot be bounded from below by a constant.</p></div>			</div>
