Jiang and K. Leyton-Brown time algorithm that computes the expected utility of any player under any product distribution. Many existing compact game representations (including graphical games, symmetric games, congestion games, polymatrix games and action-graph games) satisfy these properties.</p><p>At a high level, the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm works by solving an infeasible dual LP using the ellipsoid method (exploiting the existence of a separation oracle), and arguing that the LP formed by the generated cutting planes must also be infeasible. Solving the dual of this latter LP (which has polynomial size) yields a CE, which is represented as a mixture of the product distributions generated by the separation oracle.</p><p>In a recent paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Stein et al. [2010]</ref> raised two interrelated concerns about the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm. First, they identified a symmetric 3-player, 2action game with rational utilities on which the algorithm can fail to compute an exact CE. Second, they also showed that the original analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Papadimitriou and Roughgarden 2008]</ref> incorrectly handles certain numerical precision issues, which we now briefly describe. Recall that a run of the ellipsoid method requires as inputs an initial bounding ball with radius R and a volume bound v such that the algorithm stops when the ellipsoid's volume is smaller than v. To correctly certify the (in)feasibility of an LP using the ellipsoid method, R and v need to be set to appropriate values, which depend on the maximum encoding size of a constraint in the LP. However (as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Papadimitriou and Roughgarden [2008]</ref>), each cut returned by the separation oracle is a convex combination of the constraints of the original dual LP and thus may require more bits to represent than any of the constraints; as a result, the infeasibility of the LP formed by these cuts is not guaranteed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Papadimitriou and Roughgarden [2008]</ref> proposed a method to overcome this difficulty, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Stein et al. [2010]</ref> showed that this method is insufficient for finding an exact CE. For the related problem of finding an approximate correlated equilibrium ( -CE), <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Stein et al. [2010]</ref> gave a slightly modified version of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm that runs in time polynomial in log 1 and the game representation size. For problems that can have necessarily irrational solutions, it is standard to consider such approximations as efficient; however, there always exists a rational CE in a game with rational utilities, since CE are defined by linear constraints. It remained an open problem to determine whether the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm can be modified to compute an exact, rational correlated equilibrium. We refer interested readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Papadimitriou and Roughgarden 2010]</ref> for recent discussions of these issues. We note also that Stein et al. have recently withdrawn their paper from arXiv. It is our impression that their results are nevertheless still believed to be correct.</p><p>In a new paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Jiang and Leyton-Brown 2010]</ref>, we used an alternate approachcompletely sidestepping the issues just discussed-to derive a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an exact (and rational) correlated equilibrium given a game representation that has polynomial type and satisfies the polynomial expectation property. Our approach is based on the observation that if we use a separation oracle (for the same dual LP formulation as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Papadimitriou and Roughgarden 2008]</ref>) that generates cuts corresponding to pure-strategy profiles (instead of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden <ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref>'s separation oracle that generates nontrivial Polynomial Computation of Exact Correlated Equilibrium Â· 8 product distributions), then these cuts are actual constraints in the dual LP, as opposed to the convex combinations of constraints produced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Papadimitriou and Roughgarden [2008]</ref>'s separation oracle. As a result we no longer encounter the numerical accuracy issues that prevented the previous approaches from finding exact correlated equilibria. Both the resulting algorithm and its analysis are also considerably simpler than the original: standard techniques from the theory of the ellipsoid method are sufficient to show that our algorithm computes an exact CE using a polynomial number of oracle queries.</p><p>The key issue is the identification of pure-strategy-profile cuts. It is relatively straightforward to show that such cuts always exist: since the product distribution generated by the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm ensures the nonnegativity of a certain expected value, then by a simple application of the probabilistic method there must exist a pure-strategy profile that also ensures the nonnegativity of that expected value. The key is to go beyond this nonconstructive proof of existence to also compute pure-strategy-profile cuts in polynomial time. We showed how to do this by applying the method of conditional expectations, an approach for derandomizing probabilistic proofs of existence. At a high level, our new separation oracle begins with the product distribution generated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Papadimitriou and Roughgarden [2008]</ref>'s separation oracle, then sequentially fixes a pure strategy for each player in a way that guarantees that the corresponding conditional expectation given the choices so far remains nonnegative.</p><p>Another effect of our use of pure-strategy-profile cuts is that the correlated equilibria generated by our algorithm are guaranteed to have polynomial-sized supports; i.e., they are mixtures over a polynomial number of pure strategy profiles. Correlated equilibria with polynomial-sized supports are known to exist in every game (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Germano and Lugosi 2007]</ref>) but no tractable algorithm has previously been proposed for identifying them. Such small-support correlated equilibria have a simpler form than the mixtures of product distributions produced by the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Categories and Subject Descriptors: F.2.0 [Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity]: General General Terms: Algorithms, Economics, Theory Additional Key Words and Phrases: correlated equilibrium, ellipsoid method, separation oracle, derandomization</figDesc><table></table></figure>
