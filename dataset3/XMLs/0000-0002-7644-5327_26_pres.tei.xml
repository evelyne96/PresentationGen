E.g. Customer Bidding 

Depends on Delivery Scheduling 
Depends on Production Scheduling 
Depends on Component Ordering 

There is an uncertain future 

Customer RFQs 
Component availability and pricing 
Late component deliveries 

There is a hard time-constraint 

Most agents simplify or approximate this decision (or 
both). 

Many ways to simplify 

Subproblem connection 

Introduce independencies 

Action 

Only build PCs once an order is certain 

Information 

Do not use all the information that can be 
collected 

How Should Algorithms be Compared? 

How do we determine which approaches are 
better than others? 

The traditional approach is running an agent 
against a large set of other agents 

Easy to compare complete agents 

Harder to compare particular approaches to the 
subproblems 

Test results are immediately relatable to competition 
performance 

Results may be highly variable handle factories like in 
TAC SCM 
Simulate the customer 
market using a process 
learned from game data

Model Overview 

Our Model: 

Generate RFQs and 
handle factories like in 
TAC SCM 
Simulate the customer 
market using a process 
learned from game data 
Simulate the 
component market 
using a process 
structurally similar to 
TAC SCM's market
