Outline 

Unlike talk on Monday, no discussion of fair 
exchange, escrow, watermarking issues 
Model: 

a very simple game-theoretic model of a P2P file sharing 
system, free-rider problem 

Theory: 

pros and cons of three payment schemes that give rise to 
strict equilibria in which free-riding does not occur 

Experiments: 

robust convergence to the same equilibria in an enriched 
model; also some interesting behaviors 
Model 

Single-shot game in which agents choose a 
level of sharing, level of downloading 
Utility depends on: 

amount downloaded 
variety of the network 
disk space used 
bandwidth used 
altruism 
financial transfer

Micro-Payments 

Scheme: 

charge users for downloads, reward them for uploads 
overall, the system breaks even 

Advantage: 

unique, strict equilibrium for all agents to both share and 
download maximally 

Disadvantages: 

equilibrium doesn't hold for risk-averse agents: they don't 
directly control their number of uploads 
users can make a profit 
users dislike micro-payments 
EC'01

Quantized Micro-Payments 

Scheme: 

charge a fixed price for each block of b files 

reward uploads as before 

Advantages: 

may be preferable to users 
unique, strict equilibrium as before 

Disadvantage: 

collusion: agents can direct their zero-marginal-
cost downloads to others 
EC'01

Points, Rewarding Sharing 

Scheme: 

"points" currency: points can be bought but not sold 
pay agents for size of material shared 

Advantage: 

no agent makes a profit 
maximal sharing, downloading is a strict equilibrium 

Disadvantages: 

no sharing, maximal downloading is also strict equilibrium 
agents don't want their shared files to be downloaded 

share at off-peak times, share unpopular files 

agent could stop sharing as soon as a file is requested 
Experimental Results 

Experiments using TD Q-learning 
Validate and enrich our theoretical model: 

levels of risk-aversion 
utility functions 
different types of files and agents 

Experiments: 

strategy convergence in this richer setting 
interesting effects
