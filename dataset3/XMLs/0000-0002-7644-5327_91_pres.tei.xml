• Share bandwidth fairly, even when agents may act 
selfishly to maximize bandwidth available to them 
• Diffusing Focused Loads 

• Existing schemes are not designed to deal gracefully with 
sudden changes in load 

-technological: queues may be overwhelmed, leading to many dropped 
packets and degraded service for everyone 
-• Rather than trying to decide which packets to drop, 
give an incentive for smoothing out the demand 

-possible because focused loads are predictable by definition 
-knowledge about utility functions means more revenue; 
more modest computational demands 
Outline 
Our Model 

• Network use is divided into t timeslots 
• n risk-neutral agents will use the network 
for one time slot each 
• Agents, Equilibria 

• Agents act to maximize their own utility 

-agent's action: choosing a slot 
-agent's strategy: a probability distribution over slot choices 
-a i 's utility for choosing slot s is u i (s) = v i (s) -(1-p(s))m 
-only consider mechanisms where participation is rational for all agents 

• Nash equilibrium for a mechanism Φ:
