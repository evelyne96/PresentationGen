A 

C 

B 

arbitrary graph 
arbitrary graph 

Other Cases 

• We can find pure strategy Nash equilibria even in cases 
where no potential function exists 

• Theorem 4 When 

-node effect functions dominate edge effect functions 
-edge effect functions are sublinear 

then there exists a PSNE in which agents choose nodes 
that constitute an independent set 

• There are LEGs for which no PSNE exists 

-verified by exhaustive enumeration of pure strategies 

Conclusions 

• Local-Effect Games offer a novel compact representation 

-exploiting symmetry, anonymity, additivity and 
context-specific independence in utility functions 
-very natural graphical representation
